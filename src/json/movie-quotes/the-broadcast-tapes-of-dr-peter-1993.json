{"quotes": [{"lines": [{"text": "I accept and absorb all the strength of the earth to keep my body hard and strong. I accept and absorb all the energy of the sun to keep my mind sharp and bright. I accept and absorb all the life force of the ocean to cleanse my body and bring me life. I accept and absorb all the power of the wind to cleanse my spirit and bring me strength of purpose. I accept and absorb all the mystery of the heavens because I'm a part of that vast unknown. I believe God to be all these elements and the force that unites them. From these elements I have come and to these elements I shall return. But the energy that is me will never be lost.", "character": "Peter Jepson-Young", "characterId": "nm1175772"}]}]}
