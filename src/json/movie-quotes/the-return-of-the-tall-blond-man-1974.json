That was the beginning of the adventure of The Tall Blond Man with One Black Show. This man, chosen at random in the crowd, was to become the central figure in a fantastic spy story. Colonel Toulouse, head oa a certain secret service agency, used him to bait a trap for his second-in-command Colonel Milan, who was too ambitious for his taste. Toulouse convinced him that Francois Perrin under the code name \"The Tall Blond\" was an international superspy. It was easy; observed with a magnifying glass, any man's actions can seem strange and suspicious. But The Tall Blond somehow managed to avoid all the clever traps set for him by Milan and his agents. Christine, one of Colonel Milan's most successful operatives, not only could get nothing out of him, she even ended up falling in love with him. The innocence of The Tall Blond led Colonel Milan to his death, caught in his own trap, and so Colonel Toulouse was rid of his over-ambitious colleague once and for all. Maurice LeFebvre, The Tall Blond's closest friend, was an involuntary witness of the massacre and as a result suffered a severe nervous breakdown.
