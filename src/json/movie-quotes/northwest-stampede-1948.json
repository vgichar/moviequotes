Wild horse herds range these lovely hills, a strong and onery breed that has for the most part never been broken to the will of man. They take refuge in the hidden valleys and lost canyons where the footprint of man is seldom seen. In winter, only the strongest can survive and when the snow's gone, they come down out of the far hills to graze on the green pastureland.", "character": null, "characterId": null}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "Protectively guarding them is a stallion, their leader, who rules the wild horse herd by brain as well as brawn, watching over them, an alert sentinel against all attack. From among the herd, he selects a mate fit for a sovereign of his rank, a spirited palomino mare for whom he would share any danger. The white stallion's truly the monarch of all he surveys but the ranchers brand him a killer, dangerous to men.
