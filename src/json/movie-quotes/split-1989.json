{"quotes": [{"lines": [{"text": "You think this guy Starker is nothing? You're right! He is nothing!He gets nothing out of life so he fixates on some trinket and decides it's precious. It's ridiculous. But it's dangerous. There are over a billion losers out there who all want to believe they're something. Some guy says he found the answer? That's how it starts. Religion. Health food. Aerobics. Pantyhose. Anything... Everything to distract them from the fact that they're bored, meaningless, impotent nothings waiting to die. Your job is to watch the fixations. Where do they come from? Some guy wants to make a buck. That's okay. That's productive. But there are whackos out there. Whackos! Guys so lost in a dream, they don't care about anything. Not food, not money, not sex. Nothing! One idea... one fixation from one whacko can fuck up everything! Look at Christ. Oh! Now Christ needs a car, a wife, a steady job. That's okay. That's productive. But when he was first out Christ created abstinance, disarray, squalor. It took four hundred years to fix that mess!", "character": "Agency Director", "characterId": "nm0789651"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "Look!
