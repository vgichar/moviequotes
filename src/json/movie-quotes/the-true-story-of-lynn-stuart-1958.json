The constitution of this state designates me as the chief law officer and head of the state's Department of Justice. One of the most important bureaus in the Department of Justice is the Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement. As attorney general, I know that drug traffic and drug addiction go hand-in-hand with crime in general. Not only are narcotic violations the leading felonies in most of our counties, but more than 30% of all other crimes committed - such as murder, robbery, burglary, and assault - are directly attributable to the drug traffic. The story you are about to see is true. It's an almost unbelievable true story. It took place in Orange County, California, comprising the city of Newport Beach, with beautiful Balboa Bay; Laguna Beach, the artistic center of the west; the famous San Juan Capistrano mission; and the city of Santa Ana, it's county seat. Because of what happened, somewhere in these United States is an attractive 30-year-old housewife with an underworld price tag on her head - a death sentence passed by the men who control this country's narcotics traffic.", "character": null, "characterId": null}]}]}
