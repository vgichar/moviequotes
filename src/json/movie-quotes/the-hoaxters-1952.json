For no hoax, by whatever name it is called, can measure up to the shining truth of the human decency we call freedom, of the human hope we call liberty. Dictators come, and dictators go. In the better world of the future, dictators will fall not at the point of a gun, but at the point of the truth. For we can win our fight without going to war. The free countries of the world, with their material might and their spiritual hearts, can prove that there is no victory over the mind when it is ruled by a whip and a gun, and that free-born men and women, under God, will ignore the loud shout of the big lie and listen instead to the quiet voice of the big truth.", "character": "Narrator", "characterId": "nm0770196"}]}]}
