All that matters is that you've come her today in your thousands to give me a grand send off. To you lovely ladies, don't throw your love, your caresses, your tears on villains like me. Save them for a man who's worth it. An honest, faithful man. If you can find one! To the men I'll give a word of warning, never put your faith in a woman.
