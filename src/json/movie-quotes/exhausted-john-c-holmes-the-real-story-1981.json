You don't have to be overly complementary. Gain her respect. Treating her as an equal. Don't bullshit her. Treat her as a human being. Treat her as you would treat yourself. As soon as you have that respect from her, she'll treat you with the same respect that you show. Then, you fuck the shit out of her.", "character": "John Holmes", "characterId": "nm0001360"}]}]}
