The show in Paris went well. Immediately afterwards the whole team had returned to the studio to watch the tape of the show together. This evening they would all go out and celebrate together. And tomorrow they would all fly back to Tokyo together, to begin work the next day on the new collection. It was only here - looking at these tired but content faces, that I understood how Yohji's tender and delicate language could survive in each of his creations. These people, his assistants, his company - reminded me at times of a monastery. They were his translators. With all of their attentiveness, their care, their fervor - they ensured that the integrity of Yohji's work remained intact. And they watched that the dignity of every dress, every shirt, every jacket was preserved. Inside of an industrial production process, they were the guardian angels of an author.", "character": "Wim Wenders", "characterId": "nm0000694"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "So, I looked at them like they were a kind of film crew, and Yohji among them, was the director shooting another indie film. His images were not to be shown on the screen. If you sit down to watch his film, you find yourself instead, in front of that very private screen which any mirror that reflects your image can become. To be able to look at your own reflection in such a way that you can recognize and more readily accept your body, your appearance, your history - in short - yourself. That, it seems to me, is the continuing screenplay of the friendly film by Yohji Yamamoto.", "character": "Wim Wenders", "characterId": "nm0000694"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "From the notebook of images that I collected over a certain time, as I was observing Yohji at work; I have saved my favorite for last.
