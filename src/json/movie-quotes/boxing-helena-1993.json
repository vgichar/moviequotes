{"quotes": [{"lines": [{"text": "A woman is something soft; something warm when you feel her. When she's naked. When she's touched. Discovered. You see that things happen inside of her. She opens up. Sometimes a woman is sad. Sometimes she's angry. Helpless. Beautiful. Sometimes she's strong. She's still only that one woman. Talk to her - in deep whispers. Tell her what you're doing, what you see. Move slowly. Tell her you're inside of her. Tell her how it feels. Touch her. Use your tongue. Your breath. When she's about to come, she'll grab for you. But don't let her come. Make her wait. Tease her. Play with her. Make her feel. She may touch herself. She's so sensitive now. You can't be afraid. Take her. Take her.", "character": "Helena", "characterId": "nm0000145"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "Hasta whatever!", "character": "Ray O'Malley", "characterId": "nm0000200"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "[watching Helena bathe in the fountain]\nWho is she?", "character": "Russell", "characterId": "nm0807565"}, {"text": "[mesmerized]\nShe's...
