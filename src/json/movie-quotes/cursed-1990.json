A mistake. It started out as a mistake. The first man worshiped the wrong God. He was confused, he was expelled from the garden. And he started worshiping the wrong God. Oh, I know it's difficult. Thousands of years of believing, praying, sacrificing to a God that was in fact, the Devil. But it's there for all to see. Centuries of war and killings, dedicated to the name of God. Or take beauty for example. All beauty is born in sin. Paintings. Picasso, Van Gogh, Gaugain.

God is hungry, God is sick, God is repulsive. God is weak, that's why he's good. He's got nothing to offer, nothing to lose. That image doesn't sell very well, does it? God is a loser, and nobody likes him. So they decided to revamp his image to attract more followers. And the more beautiful they made him, the more evil laughed. Because now evil is everywhere. And the pursuit of beauty is the move of the soul linked to the world... and away from God. And we are creating new life, a life never before seen on this Earth. A life conceived in magnificence. The time has come, churches will be returned to their original owners. This beautiful church, dedicated to my master. And he is beautiful... and entertaining, and good-looking and delightful.
