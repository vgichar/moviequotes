I don't know where I am in time. I don't know what century I'm in. There's a message that must get through if anyone can hear me. When I was out among you, I always believed, as you do, that time exists in a sequential pattern - one day following another; one year after another; each century following the previous one... but it's not like that at all. I can tell you that now, because I know, believe me. You see, time exists in a continuum. Lights, sounds, words spoken hundreds of thousands of years ago are still around us somewhere in the vast infinity of space. The future, as we call it - that, too, is with us now - past, present and future - are constantly in conflict in a finite world. On a planet known as Earth, which I once inhabited, we think that time is something that is happening now, that the past is gone, that the future is not yet... but that's not so. If anything, know that yesterday, today and tomorrow are constantly with us and will be with us through all eternity.", "character": "Grant Williams", "characterId": "nm0204824"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "[last lines]", "character": null, "characterId": null}, {"text": "Honey, you know something...", "character": "Grant Williams", "characterId": "nm0204824"}, {"text": "What?", "character": "Ana Williams", "characterId": "nm0540416"}, {"text": "Maybe this was all meant to be.
