Finally he got sick of hearing about it so he decides to set the record straight. Turns out when he was a kid, Armstrong lived next door to an older couple named Gorsky. So one day he went over to their yard to get a stray baseball, and he heard a noise. Then he looked in the window, and there were the Garcons going at it on the table. And suddenly Mr. Gorsky stopped and said to his wife, after 30 years of good loving he wanted to try something different. Well Mrs. Gorsky was shocked. How dare him ask her for such a thing. Dream on, she said to him, the day I put that thing in my mouth is the day that little Armstong boy next door walks on the moon.", "character": "Murdoch", "characterId": "nm0002668"}]}]}
