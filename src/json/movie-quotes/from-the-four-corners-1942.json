{"quotes": [{"lines": [{"text": "Perhaps the men who came closest to putting them into words were those Americans, many of them the sons of British pioneers, who founding an independent nation proclaimed \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights - that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\". Those words and that spirit were born and nourished here, and your fathers carried them to the ends of the earth. They're our inheritance from the past, our legacy to the future. That's why you came here - to defend them.", "character": "Leslie Howard", "characterId": "nm0001366"}]}]}
