He had caused a valley between two mountains to be enclosed, and turned into a garden, so large and beautiful his people believed it was Paradise. And there was a fortress at the entrance, strong enough to resist all the world. Now the old man caused those of his young men whom he had chosen to be his Hashishi, his assassins, to be given a potion which cast them into a deep sleep, and to be carried into the garden, so that when they awoke, they believed they were in Paradise. And there were damsels and young girls there, who dallied with them to their hearts' content, so that they had what young men desire. Thus it was that when the old man decided to send one of his assassins upon a mission, such as to have a prince slain, he would send for one of these youths and say, 'Go thou and kill, and when thou returnest, my angels will bear thee into Paradise; and should'st thou die, nevertheless, I will send my angels to carry thee back into Paradise.'\"", "character": "Turner", "characterId": "nm0001396"}, {"text": "[pause]", "character": null, "characterId": null}, {"text": "They enjoyed their work...", "character": "Turner", "characterId": "nm0001396"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "We've got to go much further... out.", "character": "Pherber", "characterId": "nm0657848"}, {"text": "No. We've got to go further back - and faster.", "character": "Turner", "characterId": "nm0001396"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "[Chas flicks his cigarette ash onto a rug]", "character": null, "characterId": null}, {"text": "That rug's over two hundred years old.", "character": "Turner", "characterId": "nm0001396"}, {"text": "Yeah, it looks it.", "character": "Chas", "characterId": "nm0289038"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "[on the intercom outside as Chas rings the front door]", "character": null, "characterId": null}, {"text": "\"Leave a message after the beep.
