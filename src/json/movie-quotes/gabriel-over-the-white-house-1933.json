Starvation is wanton everywhere, from coast to coast and from Canada to Mexico. Millions of dollars are poured into new battleships. Farmers burn corn and wheat, food is thrown into the sea while men and women are begging for bread. Men are freezing without coats while cotton rots in the field. Thousands are homeless, millions of vacant homes. Over 5000 gang land murders last year, and only five gangsters in prison, not for killing but for income tax violations! What does the New Administration say to this? What answer? What definite plan has the government for this indictment, this state of misery and horror, of lost hope, of broken faith, of the collapse of American democracy?", "character": "Mr. Thieson", "characterId": "nm0041681"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "I'm not a very religious person, Beek, but does it seem too fanciful to believe that God might've sent the angel Gabriel to do for Judd Hammond what He did for Daniel?", "character": "Pendola 'Pendie' Molloy", "characterId": "nm0605904"}, {"text": "Gabriel?
