I mean you've seen him, but you never knew who he was. You've cheered for him and cried for him and women have wanted to die for him. But did he ever get any credit, or the girl? No! He's what we call the \"Stuntman\", and the reason I'm talking so fondly about him is, well because it's me, Colt Seavers. Anyway, picture work isn't wall-to-wall employment, so maybe you wonder how a guy keeps his head together? Well, one way is to wait by the phone... and wait and wait. The other is to take an occasional job with the court system of the United States of America, where a man is considered innocent until proven guilty. Unfortunately, sometimes a lot of these people get out of jail on what we call bail and they'd run like hell!... and that's where I come in. I sometimes pick up rent money trying to find them and bring them back to justice.", "character": "Colt Seavers", "characterId": "nm0000516"}]}]}
