{"quotes": [{"lines": [{"text": "Mrs. Burns is right, of course; you are amateurs, unlike certain pseudo-professionals like myself who insist on slave wages. Your voluntary and steadfast attendance at these rehearsals fully qualifies you for any definition of the word \"amateur\". What Mrs. Burns and many others are wrong about is the meaning of the word, which has to do with motivation, not quality. Remember \"amo, amat, amas\", the Latin verb \"to love\". The meaning of \"amateur\" is \"he or she who does a thing for the love of it\". There is no higher reason for singing than the love of doing it. In that respect, you do qualify as amateurs. And I salute you for it.", "character": "Ephraim Adams", "characterId": "nm0002144"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "I view music not as a recreation nor as a competitive sport or as a social activity, nor even as a religious duty. Music is a craft. Craft, with its hard work and perseverance, rewards us accordingly.", "character": "Ephraim Adams", "characterId": "nm0002144"}]}]}
