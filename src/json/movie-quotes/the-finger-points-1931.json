{"quotes": [{"lines": [{"text": "This community is in bad shape indeed, when gangsters can perpetrate murder in broad daylight and get away with it. But there's one power in this town with sufficient courage to do what is right. And that power is The Press. The Press is going to break up the criminal gangs that infest this city and drive them out. The Press is going to expose every corrupt official preying on the community. The Press cannot be bought, intimidated or silenced. It's going to be war; a crusade, if you like. A crusade to destroy gang rule. From now on, you are more than reporters, you're crusaders and you're going to bear down on the underworld with all the power of The Press. We're going to make a fight of it. You can get your assignments from the City Editor.", "character": "Managing Editor Ellis Wheeler", "characterId": "nm0002177"}]}]}
