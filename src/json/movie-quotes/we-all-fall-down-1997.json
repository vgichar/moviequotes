{"quotes": [{"lines": [{"text": "In books, it's always fantastic with women. One glance and she's yours for life. Or for one night, which is just as good. Try to do that in real life and you'll end up behind bars. My peers, said the papers, started with oral sex at 14, went all the way at 16, had enough of women by 18 and became impotent or serial killers. To protect myself and others, I was a virgin, so I didn't have to worry about premature ejaculation.", "character": "Walter", "characterId": "nm0557609"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "Scared? Yes, I was scared. But I wanted her so badly. What would I do once out that door? Would I penetrate her? The word made me laugh. \"May I penetrate you?\" Not to mention the other thing, the clitoris. Why must they have such scary names? Where is the clitoris? How do you find it? Do they give you a map? Female orgasm...how could you tell? Did a neon sign come out? \"Yes, I came, thank you.\" And premature ejaculation? Premature in what respect? Who the hell invented penis envy anyway? What was there to envy?", "character": "Walter", "characterId": "nm0557609"}]}]}
