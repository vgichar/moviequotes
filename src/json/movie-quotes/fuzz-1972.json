You know, coffee grounds, potato peels and moldy fruit. It just gets such a mess when it gets on the floor and, you know, walking around with it slipping on your heels. It's disgusting; old chewed up bones like they had a dog or something. And one day it looked as though somebody had blown their nose in pieces of old toilet paper and wet cigarette butts and things like that. It's really disgusting, and you can't find that in your car seat every morning and live through it. My stomach turns and I really threw up several times, but not in the front seat of the car.", "character": "Man with Garbage", "characterId": "nm0110480"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "He gave me five bucks to bring it over here.", "character": "Little Boy", "characterId": "nm0923786"}, {"text": "What'd he look like?", "character": "Lt.
