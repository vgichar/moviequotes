You know why I hate to get into fights? I can't miss. Am I talking too much? In my heart I've always asked forgiveness before I kill just like an Indian asking for forgiveness from an animal before the slaughter. You can't ask after you kill, it's too late then. I didn't come here to talk about that, I came to talk about Brockie. He put Charlie Savage's corpse on public display in a store window.
