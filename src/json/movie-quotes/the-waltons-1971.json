The greatest day of my life was when I beat John Walton out for senior class president. I don't think he ever lost any sleep over it. Now I'm an ambitious man - some would say successful; probably it's all John's fault. I was always running; he was always going past me at a walk. And here it is, 25 years later-here I am, and there's John. Then look at me... and some of you... still running, still wearing ourselves to a frazzle for all sorts of things that John Walton has accumulated while he was out walking - a happy home, a fine wife and children. We're sitting here well fed at John's table, and I'm still boy enough to be graveled at the sight of him. 'John - the boy most likely to succeed.'
