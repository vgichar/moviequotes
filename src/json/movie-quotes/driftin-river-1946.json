At Tennessee's graveside funeral, Eddie Dean delivers this eulogy]\nOh Heavenly Father, our beloved Tennessee has gone to join the great roundup in Heaven. He left us here on earth his will. Not the kind of will that most men leave of gold and riches, but a will of truth and beauty, something money cannot buy. He left us the rolling hills of the West which he loved so dearly, the glorious sunrise and magnificent sunset of each new day. He left us the memory of a courageous spirit undaunted by trials and hardships. He left us his love to enjoy and share with our fellow man. Humbly we ask understanding and appreciation of all of these things. Amen", "character": "Eddie Dean", "characterId": "nm0212761"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "]\nOh Heavenly Father, our beloved Tennessee has gone to join the great roundup in Heaven.
