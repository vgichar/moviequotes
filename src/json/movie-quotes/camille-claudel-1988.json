Madhouses are made to inflict suffering. It can't be helped... especially if you never see anyone. They try to force me to sculpt here. They don't succeed, so they make trouble for me. Don't forget, Paul, your sister is in prison with madwomen. Mama wrote the doctor... that I mean to harm you. That I detest you and am out to hurt you. It's not true. I wish she would take me to Villeneuve with her. Do you think I enjoy spending months, years like this without any news or hope? Where does such ferocity come from? How did they manage to change you so? I'd really like to know. You might as well send me to Siberia. Did you take care of my things? Are they in Villeneuve? Be careful they don't fall into Rodin's hands. He's so afraid I might come back. That's why he's keeping me here, isn't it, Paul? I would like to go home and close the door tightly. I don't know if I'll be able to realize this dream to be home. Oh, God, I wish I were in Villeneuve.
