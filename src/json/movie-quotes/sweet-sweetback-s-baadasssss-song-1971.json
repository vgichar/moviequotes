You don't have to worry about nothin'. If you need anything, anything at all, brother, just keep the faith in Beetle, ol' Beetle goin' to bring you through, cause this is just a skirmish. You know how the game goes, baby. But you keep the faith in me and you my man. You my favorite man. Can you dig it, baby? Together, you know, maintain. They can't bother you as long as Beetle's with you. Now you go on and hibernate like that ol' bear and don't go nowhere, can you dig it? Yeah? Ha! Mellow. Go out the back door, now. Speed along and don't let nobody know where you at. Let sleeping dogs rest. You dig it, baby? Ha, ha, yeah.", "character": "Beetle", "characterId": "nm0160985"}]}]}
