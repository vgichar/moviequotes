Our country is now in revolt. The symbols of oppression are burning. The workers have occupied the factories and barracks. The hated army which oppressed the working class for centuries has been defeated by ordinary men and women. Spain is an example to the world. Priests and capitalists are fleeing from proletarian justice. Now, at last, the people are speaking out. Friends, Freedom has broken out. We cannot aspire to any kind of justice while the greatest slavery exists. It forces you to renounce love, tenderness, friendship and waste your lives on the sexual voracity of strangers. It makes a woman sell her own body in houses like this which are just love sheds. Love must be free not bought... No more hypocrisy. No woman is decent until we all are. This has to end at once. It's over now. We're here to help you. Comrades, sisters, in the name of all Spanish women we open our arms to help you regain your dignity as workers, sisters, mothers. Join the liberation of prostitutes! Long live Mujeres Libres and the libertarian revolution!", "character": "Concha", "characterId": "nm0563760"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "I'm going to explain, so listen well.
