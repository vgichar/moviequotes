That is everybody's dream and ambition as a minority - to live and look as well as a white person. It is pictured as being in America.

And when it comes to the minorities; especially black - we as a people, for the past 400 years - is the greatest example of behavior modification in the history of civilization. We have had everything taken away from us, and yet we have all learned how to survive.
