And you've got to show them that you are strong as they are. If you run after them they run away. And if you run away and try to get them to follow, honey they get tired mighty quick! If you are honest with them and you tell them what you think well then they get scared because they think that you see right through them. If you hold them the reins tight then they drop and escape. So maybe you're gentle and thought and you give them a little freedom. Then they think thay you don't care for them at all! If you kiss them they wipe it off or they wipe it in. Either way it's the same thing because they don't kiss back, and if they do it's not the right time or the right place or they are thinking of something else.", "character": "Calamity Jane", "characterId": "nm0198231"}]}]}
