Where we shall be introducing legislation to implement our policy which we call Apartheid-the separation between the races. Races will live and travel separately.

Apartheid rests on three unarguable foundations - Afrikaner Experience - OUR experience, Scientific Proof that the White man is a superior being, and Biblical Witness. Apartheid represents divine will.", "character": null, "characterId": null}]}]}
