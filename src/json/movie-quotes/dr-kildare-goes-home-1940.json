You're about to go out and engage yourself in the noble profession of practicing medicine. Well my heart bleeds for you. But since we're all aware of what you'll have to face, perhaps you'll accept a few hints from a man old enough to know better. Never expect to get a good night's sleep. Many illnesses start at noon, but nobody ever seems to call the doctor before midnight. No matter how ill the patient is, you'll have more trouble with the relatives. Always remember that many times your only job will be to keep the patient happy because nature's going to cure him and you'll get all the credit.", "character": "Dr. Leonard Gillespie", "characterId": "nm0000859"}, {"text": "Thank you, Leonard.", "character": "Dr. Walter Carew", "characterId": "nm0455491"}, {"text": "Well don't thank me yet - I'm not through.
