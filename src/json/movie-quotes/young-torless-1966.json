Perhaps I haven't learned enough to express myself clearly, but I'll attempt to describe it. Basini was a student like any other. A perfectly normal person. Suddenly he stumbled. I'd thought of these things before - humiliation and degradation - but I'd never experienced them. But it happened to Basini. I had to admit it was possible that man wasn't created good or bad once and for all. We all keep changing ceaselessly. We exist only by virtue of our actions. But if we allow ourselves to change to where we become torturers or sacrificial animals, then anything is possible. Then even the most horrific things become simply possible. Then there's no line between good and evil, and both merge imperceptibly. Then perfectly normal people can do terrible things. The only question then was, \"How is this possible?\" To observe this, I let these things go unreported. I wanted to know how it was possible. What happens when a person humiliates himself or suddenly turns cruel? I used to think it would mean the end of the world. Now I know differently. What seems so horrific, so incomprehensible from afar, simply happens. Quietly and naturally. Therefore one must be continually on guard. That's what I've learned.", "character": "Thomas T\u00f6rless", "characterId": "nm0140649"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "Give me a kiss. See? You're still alive.

We needed to find a way to overcome the inadequacy of reason. This force that keeps logic together despite its gaps and shortcomings... I call the soul. I'd like to lure this soul out of Basini... by hypnotizing him. Because of your unworthy conduct, you've lost touch with your soul. You're about to find it again. If you follow my instructions exactly, no harm will come to you. But annoy me with the slightest objection... and I'll shoot you down. Take this pendulum. Hold your hand steady. Observe the key carefully, and imagine it's swinging in a circle. Look only at the key. Concentrate on the key. Imagine it making a circle. You try to stop it. But you don't succeed. The key swings faster and faster with no help from you. By my will alone. See how strong my influence is over you? Now sit down. Do exactly as I say. Empty your mind of all thought. Stare at this little light... and don't blink. Keep your eyes as wide open as you can. Don't think about anything. Focus all your attention inwards. Your arms are getting heavy. Your legs are getting heavy. Your entire body is getting heavy. Your eyelids are getting heavier and heavier. As heavy as lead. Your vision's growing dim. Your eyes are watering. Your thoughts are slowing down. Slower and slower. Stare inside yourself until you find the point where you feel only your inner self... free of all thought and sensation.
