We have never seen you and we miss you. We talk about you all the time. Mummy will be upset that we've gone. Deep down inside we love her, don't think we don't, but she doesn't understand anything. We don't know what you look like. Alexander says all sorts of things. He dreams about you. We miss you so much. Sometimes on my way home from school I think I hear footsteps behind me, your footsteps, and when I turn to look there's no one. Then I feel very lonely. We don't want to be a burden to you. We just want to get to know you and then we'll go away again.", "character": "Voula", "characterId": "nm0657337"}]}, {"lines": [{"text": "If I were to shout, who would hear me out of the armies of angels?", "character": "Orestis", "characterId": "nm0879310"}]}]}
