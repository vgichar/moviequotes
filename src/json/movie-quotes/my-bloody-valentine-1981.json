It had been a tradition for over a hundred years. Everybody was there, except for seven miners at the Hanniger Mine, five of them still down below. Two supervisors were waiting for the men to come up. Anxious to get to the party, they left before the men were safely out, failing to check the methane gas levels in the tunnels down below. For six weeks we dug 'round the clock to try and save 'em. When we broke through, one man was found alive. I was the one who found him. Harry Warden spent the next year in the state mental hospital. Exactly one year later, on Valentine's Day, he came back to town. He killed the two supervisors who'd left their posts the year before, and he cut out their hearts, stuffed 'em into these heart-shaped candy boxes. That night at the dance, they found the boxes, blood dripping out the sides. Inside was a note, a warning from Harry to NEVER hold a Valentine's dance ever again. Every February 14th, Harry comes back to town, his pickaxe stained with blood, waiting in the shadows of the Hanniger Mine, just for someone to kill, should they not heed his warning.
