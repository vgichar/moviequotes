So I'm putting it down in writing just how it happened in hopes of setting the record straight. Well, my friend Adams was accused of a crime he didn't commit, so he escaped into the mountains, leaving behind the only life that he ever knew. Now that wilderness out there ain't no place for a greenhorn and his chances of survivin' were mighty slim. Weren't no time at all before he was beaten down, ragged and nearly starved. Long about then, he came upon a grizzly bear cub, all alone and helpless. Now Adams knew that little critter couldn't survive without his help; so he started right down that cliff, risking his own life to save it.", "character": "Mad Jack", "characterId": "nm0701500"}, {"text": "[chuckles]", "character": null, "characterId": null}, {"text": "Now that cub took to Adams right off. And that was when he discovered that he had special kind of way with animals; They'd just come right up to him like he was a natural part of the wilderness. But that bear cub, he was extra special.
