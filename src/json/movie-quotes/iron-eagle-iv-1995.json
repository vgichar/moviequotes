If I had known you were alive, nothing in the world could have stopped me from getting you out. All reports said you were dead. If I didn't look farther, it was because it hurt so much to look it all. You know, I remember when you first came to me with your hair-brained scheme to rescue your father. You were a boy with a boy's contempt for the impossible. But you believed. Before long, you got me to believe, too. Well, I still believe. I believe the Doug Masters I knew then is alive and well. He just lost his contempt for the impossible. Nothing is impossible, Doug, if you believe in who you are. In who you've always been.", "character": "Charles 'Chappy' Sinclair", "characterId": "nm0001283"}]}]}
