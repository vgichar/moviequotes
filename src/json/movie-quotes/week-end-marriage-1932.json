One way or another, a man will find a woman to look out for him not only when he's sick but when he's well. That's something you so-called \"modern girls\" never seem to count on. You talk about freedom, because you think it's something men have and cherish. But they don't. They hate it. They get along best when they're *not* free. It's human nature, that's all. They need old-fashioned women looking after their health, nagging them into caution, feeding them properly, and giving them families to live for. A great many of these women are just as well-fitted for business as you are, but they don't want it. They put their talents to work instead in what people today think of as a narrow sphere. Well, I don't think it's narrow. I think it's the most important sphere of all. Not much recognition in it, perhaps--no spectacular publicity--but it's built up nations before now, and it *will* build them again.", "character": "Doctor", "characterId": "nm0593372"}, {"text": "You hear that, Lola?", "character": "Mrs. Davis", "characterId": "nm0141782"}]}]}
