{"quotes": [{"lines": [{"text": "O Mary mine, wert thou a burgher's daughter, and with thy fair self in every other way, I'd take thee with me o'er the perilous water to the New World, where none could say us nay. O Mary mine - fair jewel, star set in the heaven above - thou art a Princess in a world apart... of castles, diadems, and of courtly love beyond my dreams. For kings will give thee gold, and princes bring thee gems from distant lands. The only wealth that I may ever hold are these fair flowers for thy maiden hands - yet fragrant they'll remain, and richly green, if they are remembered by a golden Queen.", "character": "Charles Brandon", "characterId": "nm0865262"}]}]}
